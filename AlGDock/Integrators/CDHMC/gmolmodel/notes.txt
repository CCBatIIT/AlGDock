# Roughly in order:

simmain.cpp - Boost C++ python extension. Creates a system.
simmain.hpp

bSystem.cpp - include SimBody subsystems (which are parts of systems)
bSystem.hpp

bAddParams.cpp - reads gaff2.dat to create new atom types for molmodel
bAddParams.hpp

bMoleculeReader.cpp - reads a mol2 file
bMoleculeReader.hpp

bMainResidue.cpp - builds a molecule based on bMoleculeReader
bMainResidue.hpp

MidVVIntegrator.cpp - the integrator based on velocity Verlet, but also include Metropolis acceptance/rejection. 
MidVVIntegrator.hpp

# Used everywhere:

bgeneral.cpp - small functions like random numbers, amino acid code switching
bgeneral.hpp

server.hpp - defines macros used for share memory model

# To be used without python

bArgParser.cpp - to run without the python interface.
bArgParser.hpp
