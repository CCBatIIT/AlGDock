Implemented a soft core Lennard Jones grid that uses a hyperbolic tangent to cap the total energy, not just the grid energy.
This seems to slightly reduce the number of necessary thermodynamic states.

MCMC moves now occur whenever the progress variable is less than 0.1, and the time is now reported correctly.
