# TO DO: Use netcdf for grid data files?

# TO DO: Fourier transform docking for initial state.
# TO DO: Use pybel or openbabel to calculate symmetry-corrected RMSD?

# Ideas from Prodock by Trosset & Scheraga
# TO DO: Grid interpolation with Bezier splines,
# which provides second derivatives
# [Oberlin, D.,Jr.; Scheraga, H. A. J Comput Chem 1998, 19, 71:85.].
# This could allow for layer sampling.

# TO DO: Scaled collective variable Monte Carlo
# for dihedral angle moves
# [Noguti, T.; Go, N. Biopolymers 1985, 24, 527:546.]

# Ideas from QXP by McMartin and Bohacek
# TO DO: Dihedral angle moves using cylindrical coordinates
# (makes energy evalulations faster?)

# Ideas from Ribodock by Morley and Afshar
# TO DO: Scale number of MC trials by number of rotatable bonds

# TO DO: Genetic Monte Carlo
