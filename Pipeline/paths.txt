These are tools to prepare a target and receptor for use with AlGDock.

By default, files should be organized in the following directory tree:

[TARGET]/
	receptor/
		search_options.py			Options for MODELLER and ProDy
		ligand_selection.py			Describes ligands to exclude or include in binding site 
		1-search/
			seq.ali				The amino acid sequence, for input into MODELLER
			profile.ali			Sequence alignment output from MODELLER
			profile.prf			Sequence alignment output from MODELLER
			reference.pdb			The reference structure, for ProDy
			prody.ens.npz			ProDy ensemble object
			prody.pca.npz			ProDy PCA object
			prody.mappings.pkl		ProDy mappings onto the reference
			selected.pca.npz		ProDy PCA object
			pdb_original/			Original files downloaded from the PDB
			chains_original/		PDB files split out into relevant chains
			chains_aligned/			The chains aligned to the reference structure
			figures/
				hist_seq_id.png		Histogram of sequence identities in build_profile.prf
				hist_seq_id_high.png	(same as above, but for values 
					 		greater than or equal to min_seq_identity)
		2-binding_site/
			measured_binding_site.py	Parameters of the measured binding site
			ligand_aligned/			ligand_trans/			Ligands translated to the binding site			receptor_trans/			Receptors translated to the binding site
			complex_trans/			Complexes translated to the binding site
			figures/			
				clusters.png		Colors ligand centers of mass by cluster
		3-models/
			sequence_alignment/		Alignments between the reference and PDB amino acid sequences
			pdb_noH/			Homology models from UCSF Modeller, in pdb format
			dock_prep/			Intermediate files for preparing UCSF DOCK 6 input
							The molecular surface is omitted.
			dock_in/			Input files for UCSF DOCK 6, including 
							mol2, spheres, boxes, grids.
			pqr/				PQR files for APBS calculations
			amber_prep/			Intermediate files for AMBER calculations
		amber_in/				AMBER inpcrd, prmtop, and pdb files. 
							The pdb file has 1.0 occupancy
		AlGDock_in/
			LJa.nc				Lennard-Jones attractive grid
			LJr.nc				Lennard-Jones repulsive grid
			pbsa.nc				PBSA grid
	ligand/
		[LIBARY_NAME_1].ism			Chemical libraries, containing STRINGS in the first column
