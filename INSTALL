After installing a scientific python distribution, the following extensions are also required:

Finally, AlGDock requires the following external programs:

--- Installation ---

To install AlGDock, first modify AlGDock/_external_paths.py to point to the locations of the relevant programs. In AlGDock/_external_paths.py, search_paths['MMTK'] should point to the source directory that contains the Include subdirectory.

Then run the commands:
python setup.py build
python setup.py install

--- Testing ---

In the AlGDock/Example/ subdirectory, you may test the program with:

test_python.py

or

test_terminal.sh

It should generate output in the dock and cool subdirectories. The dock and cool subdirectories should be removed before testing.
