--- Requirements ---

AlGDock is a third-party python extension.
The required programs and extensions should be installed and tested prior to AlGDock. 
It is recommended to use a scientific distribution of python. 

These include:

Enthought Canopy Python (tested with version 2.7.6)
https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/

or

Anaconda Scientific Python
https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/

Unfortunately, due to the issue with a dependency, Scientific Python, 
AlGDock requires that numpy is prior to 1.9. 
This means that the latest versions of other packages cannot be used.
Here are versions of packages in a working version of AlGDock.

After installing a scientific python distribution, the following extensions are also required:

Scientific Python (tested with version 2.9.2)
http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython/

Molecular Modeling ToolKit (MMTK) (tested with version 2.7.9)
http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/MMTK

pymbar (tested with version 2.0beta)
https://github.com/choderalab/pymbar

pyrmsd

OpenMM (tested with version 7.0)

Finally, AlGDock requires the following external programs:
Not Another Molecular Dynamics (NAMD), tested with version 2.9
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/

--- Installation of AlGDock ---

To install AlGDock, first modify AlGDock/_external_paths.py to point to the locations of the relevant programs. In AlGDock/_external_paths.py, search_paths['MMTK'] should point to the source directory that contains the Include subdirectory.

Then run the commands:
python setup.py build
python setup.py install

--- Complete installation of AlGDock and associated packages with miniconda/anaconda ---

To install AlGDock with conda, follow these steps: 

1. Create a conda environment
conda create --name algdock numpy=1.8.1 netcdf4 six cython scipy
source activate algdock

2. Install OpenMM. This can be done with conda.

conda install -c omnia openmm

3. Install Scientific python

Identify the NETCDF_PREFIX.
(algdock) Minh-IIT-MBP:ScientificPython-2.9.4 dminh$ which python
/Users/dminh/Applications/miniconda2/envs/algdock/bin/python
export NETCDF_PREFIX=/Users/dminh/Applications/miniconda2/envs/algdock/

Download, extract, and change to the scientific python directory. Then enter:
python setup.py install

After changing the directory again, 
python -c 'import Scientific.IO.NetCDF'
should work.

If not, you might need a symbolic link to the netcdf dynamic library. Here is an example.
sudo mkdir -p /opt/anaconda1anaconda2anaconda3/lib/
sudo ln -s /Users/dminh/Applications/miniconda2/envs/algdock/lib/libnetcdf.7.dylib /opt/anaconda1anaconda2anaconda3/lib/libnetcdf.7.dylib

4. Install MMTK, pyRMSD, and pymbar

Download, extract, and change to the MMTK directory. Then enter:
python setup.py install

Similarly, download, extract, and change to the pymbar directory. Then enter:
python setup.py install

pyrmsd can be installed with:
pip install pyrmsd

5. Install AlGDock

Download, extract, and change to the AlGDock directory. Then enter:
python setup.py install

6. (Optional) Install packages for analysis tools. 

conda install matplotlib PIL numpy=1.8

7. (Optional) To prepare a binary with DistTools/Distribute.sh, you will need
pyinstaller, setuptools. Fortunately they can all be installed with conda.

conda install pyinstaller
conda install setuptools=19.2

--- Testing ---

In the AlGDock/Example/ subdirectory, you may test the program with:

test_python.py

or

test_terminal.sh

It should generate output in the dock and cool subdirectories. The dock and cool subdirectories should be removed before testing.
