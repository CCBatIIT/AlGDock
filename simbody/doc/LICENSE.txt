Notes
-----

1. What's with that "tm" in Simbody(tm)?

   That trademark symbol is to let you know that we restrict how the name
   "Simbody" can be used. That's because we want to make sure that it is always
   clear to what that name refers. The license permits anyone to make any kind 
   of derivative work, or to use all or part of Simbody code in any way they 
   like, so it would become very confusing if all these works were called 
   "Simbody". We hope you will say that your code makes use of Simbody (see 
   below), or was derived from Simbody, but don't "repurpose" the name for
   anything other than the Simbody project as it is distributed from the 
   official hosting site at https://simtk.org/home/simbody. This small 
   restriction is in the best interests of all Simbody users, including you, 
   since it avoids confusion about what is, and what is not, the carefully 
   managed Simbody community project. But ... if you want to make improvements
   to Simbody we would love to have your well-engineered, open source (same
   terms as above or looser) contributions to put into the main Simbody source 
   tree, in which case they would be included under the Simbody name.

2. How to acknowledge us

   Our license does not require that you acknowledge us, but we and our 
   sponsors would be grateful if you did anyway! If our hard work has helped 
   you with yours, please throw us a bone and mention on your "About" page 
   and in your documentation that you are using Simbody from 
   https://simtk.org/home/simbody. Where appropriate, please cite this 
   paper:

       Michael A. Sherman, Ajay Seth, Scott L. Delp, Simbody: multibody 
       dynamics for biomedical research, Procedia IUTAM 2:241-261 (2011)
       http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.piutam.2011.04.023

   We would be particularly grateful if you mention that Simbody is primarily 
   funded by NIH Roadmap grant U54 GM072970. We appreciate that support very 
   much, and the NIH appreciates knowing that its funds are having an impact, 
   particularly on medical research and human health.
