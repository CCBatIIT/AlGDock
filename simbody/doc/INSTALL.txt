SimTK Simbody(tm) Release 2.2, June 2011
https://simtk.org/home/simbody

Installation instructions
-------------------------
Detailed installation instructions for Linux, Mac, and Windows installation
of precompiled binaries are provided in the Simbody User's Guide, which can 
be found in the installation's doc directory or posted online at 
https://simtk.org/home/simbody, Documents tab. If you are building from 
source, use the How To Build From Source document for your platform instead;
you can find that in the same places. 

We highly recommend that you read the detailed installation instructions in
the User's Guide. However, if you are one of those guys who just won't ask 
for directions, here at least is an abbreviated summary of the installation 
procedure for the precompiled binaries:

  1 Install prerequisites for your platform (see below)
  2 Download an appropriate .zip file from Simbody's Download page.
  3 Unzip it into the installation directory, or unzip it somewhere and then
    move the whole directory structure to where you want it to reside. That
    can be anywhere you want, but we suggest 
      - Linux or Mac:   /usr/local/SimTK 
      - 32-bit Windows: C:\Program Files\SimTK
      - 64-bit Windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\SimTK
  4 Set the environment variable SimTK_INSTALL_DIR to the installation 
    directory you chose in step 3. (Not strictly required but helps with 
    examples and locating the Visualizer.)
  5 Set the appropriate PATH variable so the libraries can be found:
      - Linux:   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SimTK_INSTALL_DIR/lib[64]
      - Mac:     export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SimTK_INSTALL_DIR/lib
      - Windows: set    path=%SimTK_INSTALL_DIR%\bin;%path%
  6 Test installation using:
      $SimTK_INSTALL_DIR/examples/bin/SimbodyInstallTest

Prerequisites:
  Windows: None
  Mac: Must have installed developer package (XCode), to get Lapack and Blas
       (they are part of Apple's Accelerate framework).
  Linux:
    - Lapack and blas version 3: install package liblapack-dev. (Must end up
      with liblapack.so.3 and libblas.so.3 in /usr/lib[64].)
    - These are needed if you want to run the Simbody Visualizer (you do):
        - Freeglut: install freeglut-dev package
        - Xi, Xmu: install libxi-dev, libxmu-dev
