class DecorativeGeometryImplementation;

/** This is the client-side interface to an implementation-independent
representation of "Decorations" suitable for visualization, annotation,
logging, or debugging but which cannot have any effect on the behavior of
a System or the evolution of a Study. DO NOT confuse this with real geometry 
(like contact geometry) which can represent physically meaningful objects that 
may interact and change the behavior of a System. However, all geometry objects
can generate DecorativgeGeometry for their visualization.

Why is there a DecorativeGeometry facility at the System level at all, so far 
away from any application program? That's because for crude visualization and 
debugging purposes, the Subsystems themselves are best able to produce some 
illustrative geometry. Otherwise, you need a special purpose visualization 
tool which understands what's going on inside each subsystem. If you don't mind
taking what you get, just ask each subsystem to generate what it thinks would 
be helpful visualization. To do that, the subysystems need a way to talk about 
geometry without knowing anything about how that geometry will eventually get 
onto someone's screen. And that's why we're here!

Each DecorativeGeometry object has its own local coordinate system and is 
defined self-consistently but independent of anything else. Clients can 
associate these with a reference frame (e.g. a body), and place the local frame
of the geometry objects on the reference frame, or at a fixed transform from 
the reference frame. That places the DecorativeGeometry objects in a scene. We
support both 3D objects which are attached to actors in the scene, and 2D 
"screen" objects like titles which are attached to the display rather than the 
actors. The classes here deal only with the local-frame definitions of the 
geometric objects, not their placement in the scene. 

This is an abstract handle class using the PIMPL design pattern to hide the
private implementation. This is effectively an abstract class although the 
virtual function table is hidden in the private part. **/
