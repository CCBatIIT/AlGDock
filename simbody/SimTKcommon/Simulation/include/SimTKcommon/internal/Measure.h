 * performed on measures, such as realization, adoption by a Subsystem, and 
 * other bookkeeping tasks. For most user purposes, the still-generic derived 
 * class Measure_<T> is a more useful handle since its value, of known type T, 
 * can be obtained. All the built-in concrete Measure types derive from 
 * Measure_<T> rather than AbstractMeasure. The various concrete Measures, 
 * built in or otherwise, may set restrictions on the kinds of types that 
 * are allowable as the template argument.
 *
 * Note that handles always consist of exactly one pointer, and handle classes
 * are always concrete (meaning they have no virtual methods).

/** This Measure operator returns the time derivative of its operand measure,
or a numerical approximation of the time derivative if an analytic one is not
available.

If the operand measure provides its own derivative measure, then the value of 
the Differentiate operator is just the value of the operand's derivative 
measure, and this measure will have one fewer available derivatives than does 
the operand. If the operand does not have a derivative, then we will estimate 
it by the following method:
    - retrieve the previous value f0 and previous derivative fdot0 of the 
      operand measure, and their sample time t0
    - obtain the current value f(t) of the operand
    - estimate fdot(t)=2(f-f0)/(t-t0) - fdot0  (fit a quadratic)
    - record new samples f(t), fdot(t) with timestamp t

Special cases:
    - if t==t0 then fdot(t)=fdot0 (if available) else fdot(t)=0
    - if fdot0 not available, fdot(t)=(f-f0)/(t-t0) (first order estimate)

At initialization of a timestepping study beginning at t=t0, we sample the 
operand and record its initial value f0 at t0, and set fdot0=NaN. This
ensures that we'll return zero as the initial derivative (for lack of anything 
better) and then use the first order method for the first step's derivative.
