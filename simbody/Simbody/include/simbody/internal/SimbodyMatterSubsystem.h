/** This subsystem contains the bodies ("matter") in the multibody system,
the mobilizers (joints) that define the generalized coordinates used to 
represent the motion of those bodies, and constraints that must be satisfied
by the values of those coordinates.

There are many methods in the API for this class. For whole-system information
and calculations, the methods here are the right ones to use. For information
associated with individual objects contained in the subsystem, such as 
MobilizedBody and Constraint objects, it is generally easier to obtain the
information through the contained objects' APIs instead.

This class is is a "handle" containing only an opaque reference to the 
underlying implementation class.

<h3>Theory discussion</h3>
The bodies, mobilizers, and constraints are represented mathematically with
the following set of equations:
<pre>
                     qdot = N u                 Kinematic differential eqns.
                     zdot = zdot(t,q,u,z)       Auxiliary states

         M udot + ~G mult = f(t,q,u,z)          Equations of motion
         G udot           = b(t,q,u) 

                 where

          [P]    [bp]
        G=[V]  b=[bv]  f = T + ~J*(F-C)
          [A]    [ba]

          pdotdot = P udot - bp(t,q,u) = 0      Acceleration constraints
             vdot = V udot - bv(t,q,u) = 0
    a(t,q,u,udot) = A udot - ba(t,q,u) = 0
          
                   pdot = P u - c(t,q) = 0      Velocity constraints
                              v(t,q,u) = 0

                                p(t,q) = 0      Position constraints
                                  n(q) = 0      Normalization constraints
</pre>
where M(q) is the mass matrix, G(t,q,u) the acceleration constraint matrix, 
C(q,u) the coriolis and gyroscopic forces, T is user-applied joint mobility
forces, F is user-applied body forces and torques and gravity. J(q) is the
%System Jacobian (partial velocity matrix) whose transpose ~J maps spatial
forces to joint mobility forces. p(t,q) are the holonomic (position) 
constraints, v(t,q,u) the non-holonomic (velocity) constraints, and 
a(t,q,u,udot) the acceleration-only constraints, which must be linear in udot, 
with A(t,q,u) the coefficient matrix for a(). pdot, pdotdot are obtained by 
differentiation of p(), vdot by differentiation of v(). P(t,q)=Dpdot/Du 
(yes, that's u, not q -- we can get Pq=Dp/Dq when we need it as Pq=P*N^-1) and
V(t,q,u)=Dv/Du. (We use capital "D" to indicate partial derivative.) n(q) is 
the set of quaternion normalization constraints, which exist only at the 
position level and are uncoupled from everything else.

We calculate the constraint multipliers like this:
<pre>
          G M^-1 ~G mult = G udot0 - b
          where    udot0 = M^-1 f
</pre>
using the pseudo inverse of G M^-1 ~G to give a least squares solution for
mult: mult = pinv(G M^-1 ~G)(G M^-1 f - b). Then the real udot is
udot = udot0 - udotC, with udotC = M^-1 ~G mult. Note: M^-1* is an
O(n) operator that provides the desired result; it <em>does not</em> require
forming or factoring M.

NOTE: only the following constraint matrices have to be formed and factored:
<pre>
   [G M^-1 ~G]   to calculate multipliers

   [P N^-1]      for projection onto position manifold (a.k.a. Pq)

   [ P ]         for projection onto velocity manifold
   [ V ]  
</pre>

When working in a weighted norm with weights W on the state variables and
weights T (1/tolerance) on the constraint errors, the matrices we need are
actually [Tp Pq Wq^-1], [Tpv [P;V] Wu^-1], etc. with T and W diagonal
weighting matrices. These can then be used to find least squares solutions
in the weighted norms.

In many cases these matrices consist of decoupled blocks which can
be solved independently. (TODO: take advantage of that whenever possible
to solve a set of smaller systems rather than one large one.) Also, in the
majority of biosimulation applications we are likely to have only holonomic
(position) constraints, so there is no V or A and G=P is the whole story.

/** @name               Kinematic Jacobian Operators 

The full kinematic Jacobian J(q) maps nu generalized speeds u to spatial 
velocities V of each of the nb bodies, measured at the body frame origin and 
expressed in the Ground frame. The transpose ~J of this matrix maps nb spatial 
forces to nu generalized forces, where the spatial forces are applied at the body 
frame origin and expressed in Ground. The operators in this section provide the
ability to work with the full matrix, or just portions of it corresponding to a
single body, or just a single point on a body. We provide fast O(n) methods 
("operators") that can form the matrix-vector products J*u or ~J*F without 
forming J. Alternatively, we provide methods that will return all or part of J 
explicitly; in general it is \e much more efficient computationally to work 
with the O(n) matrix-vector multiply methods rather than to form explicit 
matrices and then perform O(n^2) matrix-vector products. Performance estimates 
are given with each method so that you can determine which methods to use. If 
you can, you should use the O(n) methods -- it is a good habit to get into when
using an O(n) multibody code like Simbody!

Note that the Jacobian is associated with an expressed-in frame for the
velocity or force vector and a designated point on each body. We always use 
the Ground frame for Jacobians. For the full Jacobian, the body origin
is always the designated point; for single-body Jacobians we allow a station
(point) on that body to be specified (in the body's frame). We provide three 
different sets of methods for working with
    - the full %System Jacobian: J, nb X nu 6-vectors (or 6*nb X nu scalars)
    - the Station Jacobian for a single station (point): JS, a row of
      nu 3-vectors (or a 3 X nu matrix of scalars)
    - the Frame Jacobian for a single frame fixed to a body: JF, a row of 
      nu 6-vectors (or a 6 X nu matrix of scalars)

Note that for Frame Jacobians you still need specify only a station on the
body (the frame's origin point); the rotational part of the Jacobian is the 
same for any frame fixed to the same body. **/

/**@{**/

/** Calculate the product of the kinematic Jacobian J (also known as the 
partial velocity matrix) and a mobility-space vector u in O(n) time. If
the vector u is a set of generalized speeds, then this produces the
body spatial velocities that result from those generalized speeds.
That is, the result is V_GB = J*u where V_GB[i] is the spatial velocity
of the i'th body's body frame origin (in Ground) that results from the
given set of generalized speeds. 

@param[in]      state
    A State compatible with this System that has already been realized to
    Stage::Position.
@param[in]      u
    A mobility-space Vector, such as a set of generalized speeds. The length
    and order must match the mobilities of this system (that is nu, the number
    of generalized speeds u \e not the number of generalized coordinates q).
@param[out]     Ju
    This is the product V=J*u as described above. Each element is a spatial
    vector, one per mobilized body, to be indexed by MobilizedBodyIndex.
    If the input vector is a set of generalized speeds u, then the results
    are spatial velocities V_GB. Note that Ground is body 0 so the 0th element 
    V_GB[0] is always zero on return.

The kinematic Jacobian (partial velocity matrix) J is defined as follows:
<pre>
        partial(V)                        T                  T
    J = ----------, V = [V_GB0 V_GB1 ... ] ,  u = [u0 u1 ...]
        partial(u)
</pre>
Thus the element J(i,j)=partial(V_GBi)/partial(uj) (each element of J is a
spatial vector). The transpose of this matrix maps spatial forces to 
generalized forces; see multiplyBySystemJacobianTranspose().

Note that we're using "monogram" notation for the spatial velocities, where
<pre>
            G Bi
    V_GBi =  V
</pre>
the spatial velocity of body i's body frame Bi (at its origin), measured and
expressed in the Ground frame G.

<h3>Performance discussion</h3>
This is a very fast operator, costing about 12*(nb+nu) flops, where nb is the
number of bodies and nu the number of mobilities (degrees of freedom) u. In 
contrast, even if you have already calculated the entire nbXnuX6 matrix J, the 
multiplication J*u would cost 12*nb*nu flops. As an example, for a 20 body 
system with a free flying base and 19 pin joints (25 dofs altogether), this 
method takes 12*(20+25)=540 flops while the explicit matrix-vector multiply 
would take 12*20*25=6000 flops. So this method is already >10X faster for 
that small system; for larger systems the difference grows rapidly.

    A = d/dt V = {A_GBi} = J*udot + JDot*u
</pre>
This method returns JDot*u, which depends only on velocities. Note that the
same u is used to calculate JDot, so this term is quadratic in u.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
This method simply extracts the total Coriolis acceleration for each body that
is already available in the \a state cache so there is no computation done
here.

/** Calculate the product of the transposed kinematic Jacobian ~J (==J^T) and

spatial forces applied at the body frame origin of each body, and expressed

@param[in]      state
    A State compatible with this System that has already been realized to
    Stage::Position.
@param[in]      F_G
    This is a vector of SpatialVec elements, one per mobilized body and in
    order of MobilizedBodyIndex (with the 0th entry a force on Ground; hence
    ignored). Each SpatialVec is a spatial force-like pair of 3-vectors 
    (moment,force) with the force applied at the body origin and the vectors
    expressed in Ground.
@param[out]     f
    This is the product f=~J*F_G as described above. This result is in the
    generalized force space, that is, it has one scalar entry per system
    mobility (velocity degree of freedom).

The kinematic Jacobian (partial velocity matrix) J is defined as follows:
<pre>
        partial(V)                        T                  T
    J = ----------, V = [V_GB0 V_GB1 ... ] ,  u = [u0 u1 ...]
        partial(u)
</pre>
Thus the element J(i,j)=partial(V_GBi)/partial(uj) (each element of J is a
spatial vector). J maps generalized speeds to spatial velocities (see
multiplyBySystemJacobian()); its transpose ~J maps spatial forces 
to generalized forces.

Note that we're using "monogram" notation for the spatial velocities, where
<pre>
            G Bi
    V_GBi =  V
</pre>
the spatial velocity of body i's body frame Bi (at its origin), measured and
expressed in the Ground frame G.

<h3>Performance discussion</h3>
This is a very fast operator, costing about 18*nb+11*nu flops, where nb is the
number of bodies and nu the number of mobilities (degrees of freedom) u. In 
contrast, even if you have already calculated the entire nbXnuX6 matrix J, the
multiplication ~J*F would cost 12*nb*nu flops. As an example, for a 20 body 
system with a free flying base and 19 pin joints (25 dofs altogether), this 
method takes 18*20+11*25=635 flops while the explicit matrix-vector multiply 
would take 12*20*25=6000 flops. So this method is already >9X faster for 
that small system; for larger systems the difference grows rapidly.

<h3>Performance discussion</h3>
Before using this method, consider whether you really need to form this
very large matrix which necessarily will take O(n^2) space and time; it will 
almost always be \e much faster to use the multiplyBySystemJacobian() method 
that directly calculate the matrix-vector product in O(n) time without explictly 
forming the matrix. Here are the details:

As currently implemented, forming the full Jacobian J costs about
12*nu*(nb+nu) flops. Assuming nb ~= nu, this is about 24*nu^2 flops. Then
if you want to form a product J*u explicitly, the matrix-vector multiply will 
cost about 12*nu^2 flops each time you do it. In constrast the J*u product is 
calculated using multiplyBySystemJacobian() in about 24*nu flops. Even for
very small systems it is cheaper to make repeated calls to 
multiplyBySystemJacobian() than to form J explicitly and multiply by it.
See the Performance section for multiplyBySystemJacobian() for more
comparisons.

<h3>Performance discussion</h3>
It is about 4X cheaper to use this method than to form the Station Jacobian JS
explicitly and use it once. However, because this is such a skinny matrix
(3 x nu) explicit multiplication is cheap so if you will re-use this same
Jacobian repeatedly before recalculating (at least 6 times) then it may
be worth calculating and saving it. Here are the details:

A call to this method costs 27 + 12*(nb+nu) flops. If you 
assume that nb ~= nu >> 1, you could say this is about 24*nu flops. In
contrast, assuming you already have the 3 x nu station Jacobian JS available,
you can compute the JS*u product in about 6*nu flops, 3X faster.
However forming JS costs about 90*nu flops (see calcStationJacobian()).
So to form the Jacobian and use it once is 4X more expensive (96*nu vs
24*nu), but if you use it more than 5 times it is cheaper to do it
explicitly. Forming JS and using it 100 times costs 690*nu flops while calling
this method 100 times would cost about 2400*nu flops.

/** @name               System matrix manipulation
The documentation for the SimbodyMatterSubsystem describes the system equations
in matrix notion, although internal computations are generally matrix-free.
The operators in this section provide the ability to perform fast operations
that can be described in terms of those matrices (e.g., multiply by the mass
matrix) but are actually done using O(n), matrix-free algorithms. There are
also routines here for obtaining the matrices explicitly, although working with
explicit matrices should be avoided whenever performance is an issue.

The mass matrix M and constraint matrix G are the most significant. G=[P;V;A]
is composed of submatrices P for position (holonomic), V for velocity 
(nonholonomic), and A for acceleration-only constraints. These matrices are
sometimes needed separately. Also, these matrices are all in mobility space
(generalized speeds u). When qdot != u, the matrix N in the equation
qdot = N*u becomes important and operators for working with it efficiently
are also provided here. In that case, the position constraint matrix 
in generalized coordinate q space, Pq, can also be accessed. (In terms of
the other matrices, Pq=P*N^-1.) **/

/** This operator calculates in O(N) time the product M*v where M is the

Only the supplied vector is used, and M depends only on position 
states, so the result here is not affected by velocities in the State.
Constraints and prescribed motions are ignored.

The current implementation requires about 120*n flops and does
not require realization of composite-body or articulated-body

<h3>Behavior with prescribed Motion</h3>
If you specify the motion of one or more mobilizers using a Motion object,
the behavior of this method is altered. (This does \e not apply if you use
Constraint objects to specify the motion.) In the Motion case, this method 
works only with the "regular" (non-prescribed) mobilities. Only the entries in
\a v corresponding to regular mobilities are examined, and only the entries in 
the result \a MinvV corresponding to free mobilities are calculated; the 
others are set to zero.

<h3>Theory</h3>
View the unconstrained, prescribed zero-velocity equations of motion 
M a + tau = f as partitioned into "regular" and "prescribed" variables like

    [M_rp  M_pp] [a_p]   [tau]   [f_p]
</pre>
The regular and prescribed variables have been grouped here for clarity but
in general they are interspersed among the columns and rows of M.

Given that decomposition, this method returns
<pre>

M, and the result is the r elements of a_r and a_p=0.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
This is a stripped-down version of forward dynamics. It requires the hybrid
articulated body inertias to have been realized and will initiate
that calculation if necessary the first time it is called for a given 
configuration q. The M^-1*f calculation requires two sweeps of the multibody 
tree, an inward sweep to accumulate forces, followed by an outward sweep to 
propagate accelerations.

<h3>Performance</h3>
If the supplied State does not already contain realized values for the
articulated body inertias, then they will be realized when this operator is 
first called for a new set of positions. Calculating articulated body inertias
is O(n) but relatively expensive. Once the appropriate articulated body 
inertias are available, repeated calls to this operator are very fast, with 
worst case around 80*n flops when all mobilizers have 1 dof. If you want to
force realization of the articulated body inertias, call the method
realizeArticulatedBodyInertias().

M^-1 here is really Mrr^-1, that is, it is restricted to the non-prescribed 
mobilities, but scattered into a full n X n matrix (conceptually). See 
multiplyByMInv() and calcMInv() for more information.

W is the projection of the inverse mass matrix onto the constraint
manifold. It can be used to solve for the constraint forces that will eliminate
a given constraint acceleration error:
<pre>
    (1)     W * lambda = aerr
    (2)     aerr = G*udot - b(t,q,u)
</pre>
where udot is an unconstrained generalized acceleration. Note that you can
view equation (1) as a dynamic system in a reduced set of m generalized
coordinates, with the caveat that W may be singular.

In general W is singular and does not uniquely determine lambda. Simbody 
normally calculates a least squares solution for lambda so that loads are 
distributed among redundant constraints. 

@note If you just need to multiply W by a vector or matrix, you do not need
to form W explicitly. Instead you can use the method described in the 
Implementation section to produce a W*v product in the O(n) time it takes to 
compute a single column of W.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
We are able to form W without forming G or M^-1 and without performing any 
matrix-matrix multiplies. Instead, W is calculated using m applications of 
O(n) operators:
    - multiplyByGTranspose() by a unit vector to form a column of ~G
    - multiplyByMInv() to form a column of M^-1 ~G
    - multiplyByG() to form a column of W
    
Even if G and M^-1 were already available, computing W by matrix multiplication
would cost O(m^2*n + m*n^2) time and O(m*n) intermediate storage. Here we do 
it in O(m*n) time with O(n) intermediate storage, which is a \e lot better.

<h3>Theory</h3>
Simbody's position (holonomic) constraints are defined by the constraint 
error equation 
<pre>
    (1)    perr(t;q) = p(t,q)
</pre>
where we try to maintain perr=0 at all times. We also have available time 
derivatives of equation (1); the first time derivative is relevant here:
<pre>
    (2)    pverr(t,q;qdot) = dperr/dt = Pq * qdot + Pt
</pre>
where Pq=Dperr/Dq and Pt=Dperr/Dt (capital "D" means partial derivative).
Pt=Pt(t,q) is called the "bias" term. (Note that because u=N^-1*qdot we also
have Pq=P*N^-1, where P=Dpverr/Du is the very useful mobility-space holonomic 
constraint Jacobian.) Eq. (2) can be used to perform efficient multiplication 
by Pq, since it can be used to calculate Pq*qlike+Pt, and a second evaluation 
at qlike=0 can be used to calculate the unwanted bias term for removal: 
<pre>
    (3)    Pq*qlike = pverr(t,q;qlike) - pverr(t,q;0)  
</pre>
Despite appearances, eq. (2) calculates its result in constant time per
constraint equation, for a total cost that is O(n) or more strictly O(mp+nq).
The matrix Pq is never actually formed; instead the matrix-vector product
is calculated directly.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
We treat the input vector \a qlike as though it were a set of generalized 
coordinate derivatives qdot. These are mapped to body velocities V in O(n) 
time, using V=Jq*qdot, where Jq is the coordinate space system Jacobian 
(partial velocity matrix), with Jq=J*N^-1. Then the body velocities and qdots 
are supplied to each of the mp active position constraints' (constant time) 
velocity error methods to get pverr(t,q;qlike)=Pq*qlike-Pt in O(n) time. A 
second call is made to evaluate the bias term pverr(t,q;0)=-Pt. We then 
calculate the result \a PqXqlike = pverr(t,q;qlike)-pverr(t,q;0) in O(n) time

/** This is the primary forward dynamics operator. It takes a state which
has been realized to the Dynamics stage, a complete set of forces to apply,
and returns the accelerations that result. Only the forces supplied here,
and those calculated internally from prescribed motion, constraints, and
centrifugal effects, affect the results. Acceleration constraints are 
always satisfied on return as long as the constraints are consistent. 
If the position and velocity constraints aren't already satisified in the 
State, results are harder to interpret physically, but they will still be 
calculated and the acceleration constraints will still be satisfied. No 
attempt will be made to satisfy position and velocity constraints, or to 
set prescribed positions and velocities, nor even to check whether these 
are satisfied; position and velocity constraint and prescribed positions 
and velocities are simply irrelevant here.

Given applied forces f_applied, this operator solves this set of equations:
<pre>
     M udot + tau + ~G lambda + f_inertial = f_applied       (1)
                                  G udot   = b               (2)
                                    udot_p = udot_p(t,q,u,z) (3)
</pre>
where udot={udot_f,udot_p}, tau={0,tau_p}. The unknowns are: the free 
generalized accelerations udot_f, the constraint multipliers lambda, and the 
prescribed motion generalized forces tau_p. A subset udot_p of udot may have 
been prescribed as a known function of state via Motion objects associated 
with the mobilized bodies. On return all the entries in udot will have been 
set to their calculated or prescribed values, and body spatial accelerations
A_GB (that is, measured and expressed in Ground) are also returned. Lambda and
tau_p are necessarily calculated but are not returned here.

f_applied is the set of generalized (mobility) forces equivalent to the 
\a appliedMobilityForces and \a appliedBodyForces arguments supplied here. 
That is,
<pre>
    f_applied = appliedMobilityForces + ~J * appliedBodyForces
</pre> 
where J is the system Jacobian mapping between spatial and generalized
coordinates. Typically these forces will have been calculated as a function of 
state so we will have f_applied(t,q,u,z).

M(t,q), G(t,q,u), and b(t,q,u) are defined by the mobilized bodies and 
constraints, present in the system. f_inertial(q,u) includes the 
velocity-dependent gyroscopic and coriolis forces due to rigid body 
rotations and is extracted internally from the already-realized state. 

Note that this method does not allow you to specify your own prescribed udots; 
those are calculated from the mobilizers' state-dependent Motion specifications
that are already part of the system.

This is an O(n*m + m^3) operator where n is the number of generalized speeds
and m the number of constraint equations (prescribed motions are counted in n, 
not m).

    body's mobilizer frame M. The returned force is expressed in the
    Ground frame. Applied mobility (generalized) forces are \e included in the
    returned reaction forces.

A simple way to think of the reaction force is to think of cutting the 
mobilizer, then imagine the force required to make the system move in 
the same manner as when the mobilizer was present. This is what the 
reaction forces accomplish. With that definition, mobility forces (that is,
generalized forces as opposed to body forces) are \e included in the reactions.
Some conventions do not include the mobility forces in the definition of a 
reaction force. We chose to include them since this preserves Newton's 
3rd law of equal and opposite reactions between bodies. Ours is the same 
convention as used in SD/FAST.

@note You can think of the Ground body being welded to the universe at the
Ground origin. The reactions reported for Ground are the ones that would 
occur in that Weld mobilizer if it were really present. That is, it includes
the effects of all the base bodies on Ground.

<h3>How to find the reaction felt by the parent body</h3>

A mobilizer connects a frame F fixed on the parent (inboard) body P to a
frame M fixed on the child (outboard) body B. It exerts equal and opposite 
reaction forces on the two bodies, at a given location in space. This method 
reports the force on the child body, as though it were applied at the origin 
Mo of frame M, and expressed in the Ground frame. The force on the parent body
<em>at Mo</em> is just the negative of the returned value. However, it is 
more likely that you would want it as felt <em>at Fo</em>, the origin of the
F frame on the parent. Here is one way to calculate that from the returned
quantities:
@code
    matter.calcMobilizerReactionForces(state,forcesAtMInG); // This method.
    const int nb = matter.getNumBodies();
    Vector_<SpatialVec> forcesAtFInG(nb); // to hold the result
    forcesAtFInG[0] = -forcesAtMInG[0]; // Ground is "welded" at origin
    for (MobilizedBodyIndex i(1); i < nb; ++i) {
        const MobilizedBody& body   = matter.getMobilizedBody(i);
        const MobilizedBody& parent = body.getParentMobilizedBody();
        // Want to shift reaction by p_MF, the vector from M to F across the
        // mobilizer, and negate. Can get p_FM; must reexpress in G.
        const Vec3& p_FM = body.getMobilizerTransform(state).p();
        const Rotation& R_PF = body.getInboardFrame(state).R(); // In parent.
        const Rotation& R_GP = parent.getBodyTransform(state).R();
        Rotation R_GF   =   R_GP*R_PF;  // F frame orientation in Ground.
        Vec3     p_MF_G = -(R_GF*p_FM); // Re-express and negate shift vector. 
        forcesAtFInG[i] = -shiftForceBy(forcesAtMInG[i], p_MF_G);
    }
@endcode

<h3>Implementation</h3>
This method combines already-calculated quantities to calculate the reactions.
See Abhi Jain's 2011 book "Robot and Multibody Dynamics", Eq. 7.34 page 128: 
<pre>   F_reaction = PPlus*APlus + zPlus  </pre>
where P is the articulated body inertia, A is the spatial acceleration,
a the Coriolis acceleration and z the articulated body forces, and "Plus"
indicates that we evaluate these on the inboard (parent) side of the mobilizer
rather than on the body's side. (The alternative P(A-a)+z given there does not 
work for prescribed mobilizers unless you replace "a" with "a_underscore" from
equation 16.14.) After calculating F_reaction at the body frame
origin Bo, we shift it to M for reporting.

<h3>Performance</h3>
The cost of the above calculation is 114 flops/body. The code presented
above for converting from M to F costs an additional 81 flops/body if you
use it.

Methods in this section provide alternate ways of calculating quantities for
which we provide more efficient methods above. You should use the better 
methods normally, but these can be very useful for regression testing and
Simbody development because the answers are obtained differently. Numerical
results should agree with the faster methods to within numerical precision. **/

/** This is a slower alternative to calcMobilizerReactionForces(), for use in
regression testing and Simbody development. This method builds a freebody
"diagram" for each body in turn to determine the unknown reaction force at
its inboard mobilizer.

The given \a state must have been realized through Acceleration stage.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
We use a tip-to-base recursion in which we assemble all applied body forces
from force elements, constraints, and gyroscopic effects and compare that with
the apparent rigid body force determined from F=M*A where M is a body's 
spatial inertia (in G) and A its already-calculated spatial acceleration. The 
difference is the missing force applied by the body's mobilizer, i.e. the 
reaction force. That is shifted to the M frame and reported. Then the equal
and opposite reaction is applied to the parent body and included in its 
collection of applied forces, which can be used to determine its reaction force
and so on.

This is is about 3X slower than the method used by 
calcMobilizerReactionForces().

method multiplies by ~P (P transpose) so v must be of length mp and PtV is of

@par Complexity:
The product is formed in O(m+n) time; the matrix P is not formed and no actual

Every SimTK::Constraint implements a method that can calculate in O(m) time the
spatial (body) and generalized (mobility) forces that result from a given set
of m Lagrange multipliers lambda, where m is the number of constraint equations 
generated by that Constraint. (In this case we are just interested in the 
Constraint's holonomic (position) constraint equations.) We accumulate these 
across all the Constraints and then a single O(n) pass converts all forces 
to generalized forces, that is, f = ~P * lambda. This can be used to form an 
arbitrary ~P*v product with v supplied in place of lambda.
