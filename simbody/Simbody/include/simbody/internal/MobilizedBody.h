/** @file
This defines the MobilizedBody class, which associates a new body (the 
"child", "outboard", or "successor" body) with a Mobilizer and a reference 
frame on an existing body (the "parent", "inboard", or "predecessor" body)
that is already part of a MatterSubsystem.

MobilizedBody is an abstract base class handle, with concrete classes 
defined for each kind of mobilizer. There are a set of built-in mobilizers
and a generic "Custom" mobilizer (an actual abstract base class) from
which advanced users may derive their own mobilizers.

A Mobilizer may be associated with a Motion object which defines how
it is to move; otherwise its motion is calculated as a result of the 
application of forces (either directly applied or resulting from constraint
forces generated to satisfy restrictions imposed by Constraint objects). **/

//==============================================================================
/** This is the base class for all MobilizedBody classes, which include a
body and a particular kind of mobilizer (joint) connecting that body
to its parent. Each built-in MobilizedBody type is a local 
subclass within MobilizedBody, so the built-ins have names like 
MobilizedBody::Pin. All concrete MobilizedBodies, including the built-ins, 
are derived from MobilizedBody.

There are three sets of methods used for obtaining MobilizedBody-specific 
data from the containing System's State. These are:
   - State Access
   - Basic Operators
   - High Level Operators

<em>State Access</em> methods simply extract already-calculated data from the 
State or State Cache, or set State values. They involve no additional 
computation, have names beginning with "get" and "upd" (update) and return 
references to the requested quantities rather than calculated values. We 
divide these into routines which deal with bodies and routines which deal 
with mobilizers and mobilities.

<em>Basic Operators</em> use State Access methods to compute basic quantities
which cannot be precomputed, such as the velocity of an arbitrary point, 
using an inline combination of basic floating point operations which can be 
reliably determined at compile time. These have names beginning with "find" 
or a more specific verb, as a reminder that they do not require a great deal 
of computation. 

<em>High Level Operators</em> combine responses and basic operators with 
run-time tests to calculate more complex quantities, with more complicated 
implementations that can exploit special cases at run time. These begin with 
"calc" (calculate) as a reminder that they may involve substantial run time 
computation.

There is also a set of methods used for construction, and miscellaneous 
utilities. These methods are primarly intended for use by concrete 
MobilizedBody classes and are not generally used by end users.

In the API below, we'll refer to the current ("this") MobilizedBody as "body
B". It is the "object" or "main" body with which we are concerned. Often 
there will be another body mentioned in the argument list as a target for 
some conversion. That "another" body will be called "body A". The Ground 
body is abbreviated "G".

We use Fo to mean "the origin of frame F", Bc is "the mass center of body 
B". R_AF is the rotation matrix giving frame F's orientation in frame A, 
such that a vector v expressed in F is reexpressed in A by v_A = R_AF*v_F.
X_AF is the spatial transform giving frame F's origin location and 
orientation in frame A, such that a point P whose location is measured 
from F's origin Fo and expressed in F by position vector p_FP (or more 
explicitly p_FoP) is remeasured from frame A's origin Ao and reexpressed 
in A via p_AP = X_AF*p_FP, where p_AP==p_AoP. **/

/** Three mobilities -- body fixed 3-2 (z-y) rotation followed by translation
along body z or body x. Interpreted as spherical coordinates the first rotation
is the azimuth angle, the second is the zenith, and the translation is
the radius. We permit a simple mapping from generalized coordinates to
(azimuth, zenith, radius):
<pre>
    azimuth = s0*q0 + az0   (about Fz==Mz)
    zenith  = s1*q1 + ze0   (about My)
    radius  = s2*q2         (along Mz or Mx; Mz is default)
</pre>
where s0,s1,s2 are signs (1 or -1) and az0 and ze0 are offset angles. The
F and M frames are coincident when azimuth==zenith==radius==0. But note
that with non-zero offsets the F and M frames will not be aligned in
the reference configuration where q0==q1==q2==0. The F and M origins
will always be coincident when q2==0, however.

With this you can define a "geographical" coordinate system where Mx is the 
Greenwich line, a is latitude and z longitude (with north positive):
<pre>
     v  = Mx
     s0 =  1, az0 = 0
     s1 = -1, ze0 = 0
     s2 =  1
</pre>
If you want the translation direction to be in Mz (the default) but would like 
q1=0 to mean the equatorial position rather than the (possibly singular) north
pole which should be -90, define
<pre>
     v  = Mz
     s0 = 1, az0 = 0
     s1 = 1, ze0 = Pi/2
     s2 = 1
</pre>
One common convention for atomic (torsion,bend,stretch) uses the default 
spherical coordinate system but the final stretch is along the -z direction. 
For that, take all defaults but set s2=-1.

This mobilizer can be used to give unrestricted 3-d motion to inertialess 
particles (as with a Cartesian mobilizer but parameterized torsion,bend,stretch
instead of x,y,z) but in this case you must watch for two possible 
singularities: (1) radius==0, and (2) zenith==n*Pi (or equivalently 
q1==n*Pi-s1*ze0). If your operating range steers clear of those singularities, 
you're fine. **/

/**
 * The handle class MobilizedBody::Custom (dataless) and its companion class MobilizedBody::Custom::Implementation
 * can be used together to define new MobilizedBody types with arbitrary properties. To use it, create a class
 * that extends MobilizedBody::Custom::Implementation. You can then create an instance of it and pass it to the
 * MobilizedBody::Custom constructor:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * MobilizedBody::Custom myMobilizedBody(new MyMobilizedBodyImplementation(args));
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Alternatively, you can also create a new Handle class which is a subclass of MobilizedBody::Custom
 * and which creates the Implementation itself in its constructors.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class MyMobilizedBody : public MobilizedBody::Custom {
 * public:
 *   MyMobilizedBody(args) : MobilizedBody::Custom(new MyForceImplementation(args)) {
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This allows an end user to simply write
 * 
 * <pre>
 * MyMobilizedBody(args);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * and not worry about implementation classes or creating objects on the heap.  If you do this, your MobilizedBody::Custom
 * subclass must not have any data members or virtual methods.  If it does, it will not work correctly.  Instead,
 * store all data in the Implementation subclass.

/**
 * This is a subclass of MobilizedBody::Custom which uses a set of Function objects to define the behavior of the
 * MobilizedBody.  When you create it, you specify the number of generalized coordinates, and six Functions which
 * calculate the spatial rotations and translations based on those coordinates.  It assumes there is a one to one
 * correspondence between generalized coordinates and generalized speeds, so qdot == u.
 * 
 * Each of the Function objects must take some subset of the generalized coordinates as inputs, and produce a single
 * number as its output.  It also must support derivatives up to second order.  Taken together, the six Functions
 * define a SpatialVec giving the body's mobilizer transform.
