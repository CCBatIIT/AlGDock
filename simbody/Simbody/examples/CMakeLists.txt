# Generate and install examples.
#
# This is boilerplate code for generating a set of executables, one per
# .cpp file in an "examples" subdirectory. These are intended to
# be installed with the library but we don't handle installation
# here. Unlike the similar boilerplate code in the "tests"
# directory (but like the "tests/adhoc" boilerplate), this does
# not generate CMake ADD_TEST commands so these will never run
# automatically.
#
# For IDEs that can deal with PROJECT_LABEL properties (at least
# Visual Studio) the projects for building each of these adhoc
# executables will be labeled "Example - TheExampleName" if a file
# TheExampleName.cpp is found in this directory.
#
# We check the BUILD_TESTING_{SHARED,STATIC} variables to determine
# whether to build dynamically linked, statically linked, or both
# versions of the executable.
